function [out fullMat] = LoopEstimate(b,x,m)
%%% This computes the Sums of Squares.  Since there will typically be a
%%% large number of voxels it is most effecient to chunk the estimates
%%% rather than trying to estimate every voxel at once.  This script
%%% handles the chunking and SS computation.
%%%
%%% Inputs:
%%%
%%% b = the matrix of beta weights
%%% x = the design matrix (or whitened design matrix if that is being used)
%%% m = the mixing matrix.
%%%
%%% Outputs:
%%% out = a vector of Sums of Squares for contrast encoded in the mixing
%%% matrix m.
